					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>This is part 1 of a 3 part series to teach you how to build web interfaces. This first part teaches the basics of front-end coding - it’s aimed at people with no or very little technical knowledge and prior web experience.</p>

					<p>You’ll learn how to build basic web pages. Then, if you’re interested in learning how to build more complex interfaces, parts 2 and 3 may be of interest. I personal’y don’t like frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation, because, whilst they are easy to use, they do little to advance core knowledge and understanding. If you learn the contents of this course, you’ll be able to pick up bootstrap fairly easily.</p>

					<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
					<p>In terms of knowledge none really - as long as you know how to use a computer, you’ll be fine. To save time on the day, please install the following software:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Sublime Text 3 (OSX | Windows)</li>
						<li>Git Client or Command Line</li>
						<li>XCode</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Course Contents</h2>
					<p>I. Setting up your development envioronment - a short intro to the command line, Sublime Text 3 and Git version-control.</p>

					<p>II. Intro to HTML & CSS - what they are, how they work together and what you need to know. Chrome Inspector.</p>

					<p>III. Device Types & Models, and Browsers</p>

					<p>IV. Building a basic website in HTML & CSS. We’ll break this down into various small components, and cover the following:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>The most commonly used HTML tags and CSS properties</li>
						<li>Building a simple navigation system, footer and grid system.</li>
						<li>Positioning and layout</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>About The Instructor</h2>
					<p>Seb was previously the founder of Flavrbox.com. He then worked as Head of Design for Adbrain. In between, he’s worked on various different starupts as freelancer, and often lead designer / front-end developer.</p>
